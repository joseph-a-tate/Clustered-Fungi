### Project Summary
I will be using this project to improve and showcase my skills. It will utilize GNS3 to emulate the networks I build. Throughout this readme I will detail and log all of the capabilities of my fictional company network. I hope that it is both informative and entertaining! Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns!

### GNS3 Overview
You can download the current GNS3 simulation environment from this repository if you want to play around with it yourself!

### Network Documentation
Here I will keep all network topology diagrams, hardware and software directories, IP matrixes, management policies (account, log, certificate, patch & update etc), mandatory training policies, contact information, disaster recovery plans, and security incident response plans. Please remember, these are ficticious and, in the world of Clustered-Fungi,the documents would be strictly protected according to NIST CSF, CIS CSC, etc.

### Simulation Results
Follow along here to see the results of different simulation excersizes that show off the capabilities and functionality of this ficticious network!
