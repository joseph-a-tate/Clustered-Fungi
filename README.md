### Project Summary
I will be using this project to improve and showcase my skills. It will utilize GNS3 to emulate the networks I build. Throughout this readme I will detail and log all of the capabilities of my fictional company network. I hope that it is both informative and entertaining! Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns!

### Clustered-Fungi
This company will sell vegetation to other mushrooms around the country of Goo. It will have three remote offices, each responsible for a range of different tasks.
> Office 1: Truffle Branch
> This office is responsible for housing the central departments, including HR, management, and IT. It also includes it's own sales and shipping departments, responsible for the northern section of Goo.
> This office will house a bulk of the servers and function as a central point for all other offices.
<br />

> Office 2: Beefsteak Branch
> This office is responsible for handling the sales department and shipping department for the eastern section of Goo.
> It will also house one administrative member (the boss), one member of HR and one member of the IT department, linking back this office to the Headquarters.
<br />

> Office 3: Chanterelle Branch
> This office is responsible for handling the sales department and shipping department for the western section of Goo.
> It will also house one administrative member (the boss), one member of HR and one member of the IT department, linking back this office to the Headquarters.

### GNS3 Overview
You can download the current GNS3 simulation environment from this repository if you want to play around with it yourself!

### Network Documentation
Here I will keep all network topology diagrams, hardware and software directories, IP matrixes, management policies (account, log, certificate, patch & update etc), mandatory training policies, contact information, disaster recovery plans, and security incident response plans. Please remember, these are ficticious and, in the world of Clustered-Fungi,the documents would be strictly protected according to NIST CSF, CIS CSC, etc.

### Simulation Results
Follow along here to see the results of different simulation excersizes that show off the capabilities and functionality of this ficticious network!
